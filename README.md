- 👋 Hi, I’m @Maalus
- 👀 I’m interested in ... diving into the universe of programming. Excited to discover this fascinating new world!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... both python and java, then C++ when proficient in the prior.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything that may help me learn!
- 📫 How to reach me ... message me on here! I have notifications turned on. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: ...  I have degrees in both Biotechnology and Biology, with further education in applied clinical research. 
                    The more I learned about programing the more interesting I became. 
                    Realizing how similar coding is to the way the body genes are 'programed', switched on and off through epigenetic alterations.
